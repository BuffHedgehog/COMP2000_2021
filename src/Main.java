    // Q1. Bitbucket and GitHub are softwares for version control. They provide
    // users with ways to save their work onto a cloud platform. I personally think
    // GitHub is better than Bitbucket, but this is only because I've worked with
    // GitHub before in the past and am used to it.

    // Q2. The last commit for the Bitbucket project was done by Matthew Roberts,
    // on the 2021/07/09.

    // Q3. The first commit for the Bitbucket project was done by Jon Mountjoy,
    // on the 2014/08/11.

    // Q4. The last commit for the Github project was done by Dave Pearce, on the
    // 2021/07/25. The first commit for the GitHub project was done by Timothy Jones,
    // on the 2011/15/11

    // Q5. The Bitbucket project is currently not active. While there are recent
    // commits by Matthew Roberts, the commits are just him fiddling around.
    // This may be because the project was completed. The GitHub project is 
    // currently active however.

    // Q6. For the GitHub project, the "pom.xml" file is probably the most active file,
    // as it seems to be a very important file in the application. For the
    // Bitbucket project, maybe the "qualtrics.csv" file is the most active,
    // as it is the biggest file in the project.
